        <h2>A Vision for Literacy and Leadership</h2>
        <p>
          The American Literacy Institute presents a compelling investment opportunity to address a critical
          and underserved need in the American education landscape. We are poised to launch a K-5 private
          school in Bastrop, Texas, dedicated to providing students with dyslexia a world-class education.
          Our model is built on a foundation of evidence-based, multisensory dyslexia instruction, a rigorous
          academic curriculum, and a character-building, faith-friendly environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an initial enrollment of 36 students, ALI is designed to be a scalable and replicable model
          for excellence in dyslexia education, with a clear path for expansion into a national network of schools.
        </p>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h2>The National Dyslexia Crisis</h2>
        <p>
          The prevalence of dyslexia in the United States represents a significant and largely unmet need for
          specialized educational services. It is the most common learning disability, affecting 15-20% of the
          population, yet public schools, despite their best efforts, often lack the resources, trained personnel,
          and instructional time to provide the intensive, individualized support that students with dyslexia require.
        </p>
        <p>
          This creates a significant opportunity for a private school model that is specifically designed to meet
          the unique needs of this student population.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h2>The Texas Landscape</h2>
        <p>
          Texas presents a particularly compelling market for the launch of The American Literacy Institute. The
          state has a large and growing student population, and a high prevalence of dyslexia. In Texas alone,
          over 300,000 students are identified with dyslexia. While the Texas Education Agency (TEA) has established
          a comprehensive Dyslexia Handbook and mandates specific instructional approaches, the implementation of
          these guidelines is inconsistent across the state's more than 1,200 school districts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This "implementation gap" leaves many families seeking alternatives to the public school system. The
          Bastrop, Texas area, our chosen location for the flagship campus, is a microcosm of this statewide trend.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Education Savings Accounts: A Game Changer</h2>
        <p>
          The national movement toward Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) is transforming the private education
          sector. ESAs empower parents with the financial resources to choose the educational environment that
          best meets their child's needs. Texas is at the forefront of this movement, with a robust ESA program
          that provides significant funding for students with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provides a powerful financial underpinning for our growth and expansion, making our high-quality,
          specialized education accessible to a broader range of families.
